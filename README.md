# Adult Income Classification ML Project

## Problem Statement
Build multiple ML classification models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds 50K using demographic data.

## Dataset Description
The Adult Income dataset contains demographic and employment details of individuals.

Features include:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Occupation
- Hours per week
- Capital gain/loss

Target:
Income (>50K or <=50K)

## Models Used

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------|-------|----|-----|
| Logistic Regression | Add values |
| Decision Tree | Add values |
| KNN | Add values |
| Naive Bayes | Add values |
| Random Forest | Add values |
| XGBoost | Add values |

## Observations

Logistic Regression:
Good baseline performance.

Decision Tree:
Highly interpretable but can overfit.

KNN:
Sensitive to feature scaling.

Naive Bayes:
Fast but assumes independence.

Random Forest:
Robust and high accuracy.

XGBoost:
Best overall performance.
